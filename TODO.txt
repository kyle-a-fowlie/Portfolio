	Notes/ Organization
	-------------------------------------------------------------

	- /x/  is the primary content panel for any particular page
	- /x/admin  is the admin panel for any particular page (portfolio, blog, comics)

	- when an admin logs in, redirect to the index page initially
	     - whenever an /x/ page is requested, still direct to that page but offer a link to the /x/admin page
	     - the /x/admin page should offer a link that returns to the /x/ page
